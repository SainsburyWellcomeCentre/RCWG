# Meeting 24/11/20

Facilitator: Spencer

Notes: Svenja

**Agenda**



1. How can we think about project organization as method-based, hypothesis-based, and exploratory (Philip)?
2. Discuss proposal ideas/topics to generate focused discussions
    1. Project Seed Grant Scheme
    2. Data Club
    3. Specialist Slack Channels
3. Brainstorm around these ideas
4. Prioritize concrete proposals + design proposal format
    4. E.g. issue addressed, solution proposed, stakeholders

**Proposals Ideas in Advance**



*   Research-based slack channels
    *   How specific to make them, norms?
    *   What is the structure to encourage this kind of communal work
*   Each week two-person presentation
    *   Can be as formal or informal as possible
    *   Slides or whiteboard
    *   Brainstorm around this? How to make these engaging

**Notes**



1. Skipping hypothesis-driven stuff for a more conceptual meeting
2. Joaquin’s grant proposal
    *   Collaborative projects can write a grant to receive small amounts of money \
These projects don’t have to be SWC/GCNU collaborations, they can be any collaborations between labs
    *   E.g. seed grant for early career to collect data, develop an independent idea?

    Open questions

*   Is it full time or part time commitment?
*   What is the funding for?
    *   Research costs, equipment
    *   What is the core goal?
        *   Two competing goals
            *   Collaborative science and projects (small time, 2h per week)
            *   Launch seed funding for transition points of phd, postdocs, fellowships, etc (more career support oriented)
        *   Are these different goals?
    *   How specific does the proposal need to be?
    *   Who chooses the recipients?

    Outcome: Proposal will be further refined in a process of crowdsourcing (slack posts)


    All




3. Meta-Proposal: How can we organise proposals and have people responsible for different proposals (Philip) \
→ Philip will come up with ideas of how we could organize our proposals (without too much bureaucracy)
4. Data Club/Non-Data Club

    Fred/Spencer: make DC weekly again. Make it possible to make presentations shorter and have many, and increase the probability that it’s actual work in progress \
Philip: Counter proposal - make it less data heavy (non-data club)

*   Possible time frames should range: long talks should be as possible as very short updates?
*   It should be impossible to opt out, but potentially you can opt for a short talk?
*   Maybe alternate between long and short talks?
*   It should still be about your project, even when it’s not data-focussed (unlike Gatsby Tea Hour)
*   Gatsby
    *   Can be overwhelming already, will be tough to get them to a 1hr talk
    *   Shorter talks would get higher avg gatsby attendance
*   This might be more SWC-specific
*   Make a guideline what the presentations should be like
*   Idea: have the ‘starter session’ for the new data clubs maybe involve PIs and make sure people are aware of the ‘work in progress’ spirit
*   PIs are the example -- they have to set that example…

5. Slack channels



*
*   Make this more detailed

6. Main meeting



*   Spencer reads proposals in their short-form format
*   Utopian vision that we came up with

TODO



*   Point people update their proposals, discuss on slack
*   Build main meeting update (Svenja+Spencer) -- feedback from the group on this


# Meeting 17/11/20

Facilitator: Spencer

Notes: Svenja

**Agenda**



1. Learn about project-based working group organization, progress, plans (Tom?)
2. What can we learn from DeepMind about project-based work / meetings? (Spencer / Fred)
3. What can we learn from the Santa Fe Institute about building a more collaborative environment? (Spencer)
4. What can we learn from IBL about communication (Hernando/Tom?)
5. How can we think about project organization as method-based, hypothesis-based, and exploratory (Philip)?
6. Discuss proposal ideas/topics to generate focused discussions
7. Brainstorm around these ideas
8. Prioritize concrete proposals + design proposal format
    1. E.g. issue addressed, solution proposed, stakeholders

**Notes**



1. Working Group organization, progress, plans at SWC (Tom) \
_More than pairwise collaboration between labs, project is intended to involve many labs and Gatsby and affiliated labs - harness the collective expertise_

    _ \
Idea for the project came about by brainstorming between the group leaders:  \
How do animals make decisions in complex environments, especially in foraging where there are competing interests? Two sets of questions: behavioural level (what strategies do animals employ, how does it depend on context…) and at the neural level (how do neurons drive this behaviour? Where are the regions influencing these decisions, and how does that lead to the spatial outcome of going to place x?)_


    _ \
Structurally, there is a ‘Steering Group’ of PIs. Now, subgroups will be formed to do specific tasks (building arenas, behaviour, data analysis…) \
Decision making is similar to here by consensual decision-making (proposals etc.)_


    _Soon, everyone will be allowed to join the working group. Some of these people will be PhD students or PostDocs affiliated to a specific lab, but also people can be hired directly to the working group.  \
_


    _How would publications work? \
Everyone should be on the paper, but there can be task forces e.g. 4 people just focussing on describing the basic behaviour - these are  the people who took the paper from data to actual completion. General papers can have many contributors, with a table outlining who contributed what._

2. DeepMind

    _Highest level: 2D structure of teams and topics which interact and overlap.  \
3 elements to the organization: efforts (6 month long cycles, ideas can come from the top or from the bottom, within these there will be milestones etc.), projects (month/week-long cycles), every Wednesday there is a company-wide meeting - mostly research-updates (5 -10 min) from each team, the teams decide on the Friday before who presents (trickle-up of the most interesting thing)_


    _Every team has their own project management tools, but it’s all transparent and available_


    _Frequency of meetings is far higher at DeepMind: Public googlecals allow to ping anyone for a 20min meeting to ask for their specific expertise. _


    _Advantages: more interactions, the asking person has to phrase their problem, the limited time frame allows for efficiency but more lateral sharing of information; This may organically lead into collaborations._


    _There is meeting-free Thursdays. Every week you have meetings with a smaller group of people who do the same stuff as you, every two weeks with larger groups that will connect you with people who aren’t doing the same stuff. \
Something DeepMind has we don’t need: Project Manager, since we have a small enough building to know everyone. _


    _Suggestion (Tom): Expert groups on slack _

*   _This speaks to a larger cultural problem of communication, attitude_
*   _We need a logical sequence of how to develop an experimental idea_
*   _It needs to be normalized that we communicate, interact about work_
*   _How do you know who to ask?_
*   _There is a stigma associated with asking_
3. SantaFe Institute
4. IBL
    1. Steering group/General Assembly decides on strategic goals
    2. Flat subgroups that generate consensus based decisions
5. How can we think about project organization as method-based, hypothesis-based, and exploratory (Philip)?
6. Discuss proposal ideas/topics to generate focused discussions
7. Brainstorm around these ideas
8. Prioritize concrete proposals + design proposal format
    3. E.g. issue addressed, solution proposed, stakeholders


# Main Group Update 6/11/20



*   We have had very rich discussions that can fall into a few topics
    *   Building systems to tackle large projects with a focused aim -- this is happening now in the form of the project-based working groups, but how can we best support and communicate these initiatives such that all of our collective resources can be used to advance these “team/big science projects” and make them open?
    *   Building systems to support smaller projects that include folks from different parts of the building. Again, how do we support the organization, efficiency, and transparency/communication of this work?
    *   Building an understanding of _who _comes to work at the SWC and what their individual goals/incentives/motivations/interests are and working to develop processes that best utilize these individuals around projects.
*   We’re currently working individually to think about these themes and turn them into concrete proposals to present to the main group and senior leadership. These might include
    *   Tools for communicating what research is happening in the building to best support collaboration
    *   Protocols for project-based based work on various timescales (similar to the proposal system the RCWG has embraced more generally)
*   We’re working individually to collect and share information about other institutes (DeepMind, SFI, etc.) and would welcome anyone who wanted to interview/research how other institutes organize their work (e.g. Janelia, Allen Institute, ???).
*   More abstractly, our discussions seem to have pointed to differences in estimates of what people are motivated toward in their work at the SWC/GCNU, particularly with respect to the “classic” academic track and “alternative” tracks in industry or elsewhere. We have reached consensus around the idea that supporting a diverse ecosystem of research journeys will actually enhance the work done in the building, and we look forward to discussing concrete ways of working towards our Utopian Vision of an institute that is home to projects of various people and temporal scales.


# Meeting 03/11/20

Facilitator: Spencer

Notes / Shadow Facilitator: Svenja

**Agenda**



1. Joaquin summarizes Big Science paper (5mins)
2. Discuss current “researcher journeys” at SWC -- TMF? (20mins)
    *   Can we map this out? Similar to the Comms visualization?
    *   How to build better communication opportunities about our research internally?
        *   Not comms tools, but comm events, norms, behaviors…
3. Brainstorm Utopian Vision (no visions are bad visions!) (15mins)
4. Brainstorm concrete proposals (no ideas are bad ideas!) (5mins)
5. Prioritize concrete proposals (10 mins)
6. Decide what to do with PhD program subtopic -- sub-subgroup?  (5mins)
7. Decide on repeated meeting time and frequency, choose facilitator + notetaker for next meeting (5mins)

    **Total time = 65mins**


**Notes**



1. Summary Big Science, Team Science, Open Science paper (5mins)

    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Big science</span>: e.g. Allen Institute - Mouse Brain Atlas -- projects that are not accomplishable by one lab alone \
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Team science</span>: larger than one PI-one lab groups -- sociological implications: identify common goals and align to the goals


    Questions: how should individuals contribute? How to reward individual creativity, discipline, etc.?  \
Only works if the bigger goal of serving a larger purpose is reinforced, and if decision making is transparent  \
Example of a field in which team science is further ahead: physics,astronomy \
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Open science:</span> aims to share data rather than polished results, requires every researcher to have the tools to make data accessible  \
 \
_Rallying around principles, figuring out what is rewarding to people, what are people working towards, how do the goals of all stakeholders (funders, leadership, researchers) align, Idea that new tools can drive new approaches to science_


    _General values to rally around is nice, but rallying around a project is easier_

2. Current Researcher Journeys at SWC

    PhD: time-limited, purpose: get a degree, but still can encompass very different motivations

*   “Classic” academic goals (have to have own project, big paper)
*   Alternative paths -- industry, staff positions (may lead to more collaborative work)

    Post-Docs: leading up to bottleneck bc there’s more PostDocs than PIs, although that is becoming less hierarchical

*   Classic and alternative programs \


    _What about people (at any career level) who are happy to be involved in many projects and not being first author on them? Do we want to increase the importance of these, and if so how? How can this be funded if you are not the SWC/Crick?_


    _Staff scientists: sustainable expertise, provide continuity_


    _How to organize projects outside classical lab structure? (Admins, funding)_


    _Project leaders rather than group leaders (See DeepMind notes)_


    _It’s not just what people choose to do, but also what options they have. How can we prevent valuable talent from leaving due to lack of attractive options?_


    _Look at things as a resource problem -- resources tend to flow out of the building and expertise leaves the building constantly. How can we work to hold onto this investment of energy?_


    _Tom mentioned that a big science project is being assembled at the SWC. This project is related to decision making in the mice._


    _Dichotomy between middle author staff scientist track vs first author lonely wolf PI track:  \
It shouldn’t be this binary_


    _Option of not having this first/middle author distinction on papers_


    _Funders want staff scientists to be associated to grants, but that is a debate _

3. Brainstorm Utopian Vision (15mins)

    _If you want to keep talent, you need to provide incentive_


    _ \
Maybe you have staff scientists and time-limited contracts at the same time? Maybe the problem is not that we need to keep people longer, but giving the people the possibilities to accomplish projects efficiently? \
Example DeepMind: give people other reasons than high-paying contracts to want to stay - people are happy to stay bc they want to be part of it_


    _ \
E.g. give people an opportunity to fail -- change the finish line/assessment_


    _Diversity of goals should be accepted fact, and supported by everyone  \
Lots of people working on many projects, some people working on just one projects, lots of dynamic teams _


    _Common goal that everyone is working towards _


    _Someone applying to SWC can work on whatever they want: Here’s what everyone is doing, so pick someone, find the person, join your efforts_


    _All projects are on some black board, and whenever a new scientist (irresp. of career stage) joins they can join any project, and switch between projects BUT with accountability (deliverables at the end of working on a project: protocol, report, preliminary data), flexible possibility to move on to either PI stage or staff scientist stage_


    _Deliverables simultaneously provide incentive for open science in the building, since the continuity of project-based work relies on good reporting_


    _How to balance flexibility and commitment: more bureaucracy & structure; you need the meetings, but they should be concise _


    _How to have flexible _


    _Multiple projects and one big question are not mutually exclusive_

4. Brainstorm concrete proposals (5mins)
5. Prioritize concrete proposals (10 mins)
6. PhD programme: subtopic?  (5mins)
7. Orga for next meeting: (5mins)

    _Think about concrete proposals \
Next time: DeepMind (Fred/Spencer) & IBL (Tom/Hernando) summaries_


    _Meeting to be every other week on Tuesday, time tbc by slack poll_


    _Spencer and Svenja to do facilitation/notetaking respectively next time_


**Ideas**



*   Possible brainstorming techniques (3min + 1min share + 1min discuss)
    *   Draw “rich pictures”
    *   Write a short paragraph
    *   Keywords on post-its (as many as possible)

**Todo (until

<p id="gdcalert1" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: undefined internal link (link text: "next meeting"). Did you generate a TOC? </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

[next meeting](#heading=h.6eiin1kqjctb))**



*   Information gather from other institutes about research practices
    *   DeepMind (Fred/Spencer) & IBL (Tom/Hernando) summaries
*   Everyone brainstorm concrete ideas for proposals
    *   E.g. project summaries / latest results on wiki/web with updates for changes (sorta like each project as a Git repo, but on the wiki instead)
    *

**Other places to interview / factfind **



*   Allen
*   Janelia
*   DARPA funding

**Random Thoughts**



*   The worst version of this group (and other subgroups) is that we appear to undermine the legitimacy of senior management, or present a lack of cooperation. Our goal should be to support senior management by providing ideas, frameworks, models to make their decisions more transparent, cohesive, representative.
*   What is the goal of the institute? Does this reflect the research journeys we’ve identified? If not, how can we best address this mismatch? How is output measured?
*   What are the goals of the Wellcome/Sainsbury funding body? How does this relate to what was written in the funding review? How are these goals different from the goals of researchers? Of senior management?
*   Do we agree that scientific innovation boils down to the ease with which scientific teams can do their day-to-day work?
*   Sustainable progress is by definition slow.
*   We can’t change the culture of science in one swoop, even within the building. But we can build “skunkworks” team(s) that embody a progressive research structure.
*   How can we think about attracting the best and brightest?
*   How should we think about strengthening the PhD program (is this in our wheelhouse? _-Yes! But should it be a sub-subgroup?_)


#


# Presentation 21/10/20

**Purpose of group**



*   Improve research quality by fostering building-wide collaboration (work towards a model of “team science”)
*   Bias the SWC away from the predominant ‘one person one paper’ culture, where research is career- rather than question-oriented. Change the scientific cost function (currently decisions between individual credit and teamwork).
*   Devise a framework that encourages the collaborative pursuit of questions by ‘research groups’, which do not need to be limited to individual labs but source expertise more broadly (including Gatsby, NRF, Fablabs).

**Brainstorming phase**



*   Build **the big (utopian) picture**: How should an ideal institute do neuroscience? (independent of funding, academic / career pressure)
*   Find **specific suggestions** for changes that would bias us in the direction outlined above. Get inspiration from other institutes: Allen, Crick, DeepMind / Google; but also from institutes where people have done research before coming to SWC
    *   These could be gathered through interviews from outside team scientists, more internal discussions, and a general call for input from the building
*   Above all, it seems we want to develop an SWC/GCNU project management style-- we want to develop a way of doing scientific research that is new and exciting.

**Specific Ideas**



*   GCNU/SWC rotations, encourage this and make it accessible
*   Expand on the working group idea

**Notes from Main Group meeting**



*   Styles of research, facilitating a diversity
*   Mentoring / mediation (bleeds into careers)
*   A lot of nuance goes into project management styles, what facilitates motivation/happiness in the work


##


# Meeting 14/10/20

Additional Themes

SWC-SWC + SWC-GCNU collaborations

Tech transfer within the building

Bring NRF to full potential

**Why does the group exist?**

Bias the SWC away from 1 paper per person (“The career success algorithm”), changing the scientific cost function

Fulfill the stated mission of team science and GCNU collaboration (easier said than done)

Build collaboration between groups within the SWC

Build collaboration between SWC and wider UCL/London research community

Build structures to facilitate collaboration on a multi-person level

Use SWC’s resource to model how we think academia should change

Sharing of ideas, concepts, techniques. Eventually broadcast that outside.

Devise strategies and mechanisms to get people talking, to increase research communications and ideas? (within SWC and across SWC-GCNU)

Share ideas publicly with wider research community

To encourage communication within the building? E.g. with fablabs from the beginning of the project.

Control animals in a more streamlined way, maybe doing more basic work that helps transversely across groups in the SWC. Basic research of animals’ wellbeing.

Highlight what work is going on in the building, encourage project-based work

Identify problems of motivation (e.g. among PhDs and postdocs)

Identify the ideal situation, then reverse-engineer what we can do at SWC to achieve that ideal

Research culture globally is defined by selfishness and competition

Work to make SWC a beacon for wider scientific community

**Notes**

Existing academic structure: 1 paper per person, limits what we can achieve

Research is career rather than science-question oriented

Get inspired from other institutes: Allen, Crick, DeepMind / Google, ...

What would have more impact, being a scientist or changing research culture?

We have a lot of overlap with the culture working group-- need to define clearly what our goals are about research specifically.

‘If we were not part of the rest of the world, what would be the ideal situation we would like to have for doing science?’

We need to define our Utopia.

**Problems Identified**

Grants -- funding and constraints

What PIs do, how they use their time

Diversity of career paths in science

Management within groups, etc.

The challenge is translating a local model (at SWC) to the wider world. Or to use team science as a valid ‘currency’ to get a job elsewhere.

“Most of the negativity, if not all” stems from the first author academic structure

PIs suffer from the same career-driven issues as students




# Ideas / Brainstorming

Ana Collated 29/10/20



*   Some event where SWC people present an aspect of their work / their task and Gatsby, etc can propose and roughly outline models of the behavior / neural activity -- kind of like a modeling bee to help translate between experimental/theoretical language - DATA CLINIC (see 3.1 below)?
*   Develop research working groups (see 2.2 below)
*   Encourage PhD students to work on something more collaborative/publishable
*   Invite in team scientists to speak
*   Develop an internal SWC/GCNU journal for pre- and post-publication review - encourage pre-prints and early dissemination of data
*   Internal documentation (open-source?) of protocols and datasets - ”… “making high quality datasets collected using these protocols publicly available and well documented”
*   More formal process of devising a research project (involve PhD students in developing this “milestones” approach to be above a formality) - collaborative projects with flatter structures
*   “Study things that will have the most impact toward the scientific mission and make a thoughtful case why each research project is achieving this -- prior to carrying out the project.”
*   Annual SWC symposium to foster internal awareness of research, personnel, etc
*   Internal grants for specific, well-scoped short-term (collaborative) projects - to encourage thinking outside the box?

**Joaquin 29/10/20**



1. For our next meeting I would like to use five minutes to summarize key points about the article I sent last week from Koch and Jones (2016) about team science, big science and open science in neuroscience at the Allen Institute (AI). This article can help us better decide on Spencer's North Star.
2. Regarding Spencer's previous point about "What kind of researchers we have in the building?" It could be useful to have Tom Mrsic-Flogel or Tom Otis give a talk about what researchers we have and how they contribute to the center's mission of relating neural mechanisms to behavior. Or, even better, we could have a talk where one of the Tom's discusses the center's mission and then each faculty takes five minutes to talk about how their research fits the center's mission.
3. Taking inspiration from industry, Amazon has a set of ``10 Leadership Principles'' and they argue that they are essential for their culture. Shall we define SWC/GCNU ``xx Scientist Principles'' that may help us define us as SWCers.
4. T-type education -- I did my PhD in engineering, but I had good friends in the Neuroscience Graduate Program. They were proud of receiving a T-type education. The vertical segment of the T meant that they were experts on a Neuroscience field (e.g., physiology of the hippocampus) and the horizontal segment meant that they were broad and could productively interact with scientists outside their field of expertise. The GCNU/SWC offer unique T-type education and we may want to take this into consideration in defining our research culture, to motivate our current scientists and to attract new ones.
5. Comments from Koch and Jones (2016): This article touches on several points we touched previously and we are discussing now. For example:
1. It briefly summarizes the history of Big Science projects in physics and biology, and mentions a few Big Science Neuroscience projects developed at the Allen Institute. At the SWC/GCNU we have some freedom to move away from small science toward big science, and it would be helpful to decide on how far we want/can push for big science.
2. It discusses the experience of the AI on team science (including how to motivate our researchers if we want to publish collaborative papers and break away from the single author publication model, and on the relevance of frequent meetings with good minutes with agendas, follow-up and strict start and end times).
3. It closes with a discussion on the crisis of lack of replicability of most neuroscience findings and on the relevance of open science. I like how they summarize this point ``the era of illustrating discoveries via nothing but a flat PDF file, with ‘‘representative results’’ that are often the most expected or cleanest responses, ought to be coming to a close.'

**Spencer (29/10/20)**



*   We set up a regular meeting time, meeting agenda template, and a time box for the meeting? This would take some pressure off organising meetings and making a meeting agenda/template for each one (this usually falls on one keen person). The template might include Open Proposals, Discussion Items, Items Finished by Next Meeting etc. We can collectively design and fill in this template ahead of our scheduled meeting, as well as deciding on a facilitator and notetaker. I think keeping a meeting to 45mins-60mins is good, and meeting biweekly?
*   Our next meeting should take the form of a “visioning session” or “strategic planning meeting” which sounds a lot like something a palm reader might purvey, but actually seems to be pretty common thing to do. The goal of the meeting is to decide what precisely we aim to achieve (in the form of a “North Star” and/or principle values) and then brainstorm all possible ideas to get us there. First we will ideate (riffing on the Research Utopia theme we came up with) and then prioritize which initiatives we think we can make the most progress on. The goal is to turn our ideas into concrete steps.
*   What kinds of researchers do we have in the building? What is their path while working in the Centre? If we map out each kind of researcher, their goals and constraints, what they offer the Centre and what the Centre offers them, I think we would begin to build a picture of how SWC/GCNU functions, with an eye towards leaning into its strengths and working to alter its weakpoints. I think about this like a “journey” map — what journeys does the Centre house, how do they interact, and how can they be nurtured?
*   How do we attract talent to the institute? What makes us a unique and special place to work? What do we offer PhD candidates, postdocs, faculty members, professional services staff?
*   How can the PhD program serve as a model for the kind of science we want to make the norm? I think we might find that PhD students are often unclear about how to make research decisions, how to plan their projects, what milestones they have and how best to achieve them. The PhD program is an incredible opportunity to change the culture of science, and it should be leveraged to do so.

**Joaquin**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">1. The big picture</span>

Team science and open science is the future for neuroscience research. It would be great to deliver publications presenting results that are unachievable in the traditional single-author paper framework.

This [paper](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(16)30720-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0896627316307206%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) by Christopf Koch and Allan Jones from the Allen Institute nicely demonstrates the potential of this type of science, as well as the sociological experiment in building the type of science.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">2. Proposals to enhance our (collaborative) research culture</span>

**_2.1 Invite scientists that have successful experiences creating team science_** in experimental/computational neuroscience research environments to talk about their experience (e.g., things that worked and did not worked building their research environments) For example, we could invite Prof. [Christof Koch](https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/about/team/staff-profiles/christof-koch/) to give a talk.

**_2.2 Create research-oriented working groups (Tom Mrsic-Flogel's idea)_**

These working groups would be focused on a larger research problem. They will be composed by experimental and computational neuroscientists. These scientists will collaborate to solve the larger research problem. An example research problem is better understanding computations performed by neural populations. Experimental members of the working group could bring their population recordings and questions they would like to address about these recordings. Computational members would then propose methods that could best fit these datasets and research questions. Experimental and computational members would then work together using the proposed methods to characterize the population recordings, leading to joint publications. Another example research working group could center on the quantitative characterization of animal behavior (with or without simultaneous neural recordings).

**_2.3 Collaborative data talks_**

These data talks will present research among experimental and computational neuroscientists or collaborative research from neuroscientists from different areas. They will illustrate the power of collaborative research.

**_2.4 Reproducible science training_**

‘‘It has been claimed and demonstrated  that  many  (and possibly most) of the conclusions drawn from biomedical research are probably false.’’ (Button et al., 2013). It would be great if at the GCNU and SWC we produced scientific results that are reproducible. To facilitate this, we want to train our staff on software tools that facilitate this reproducibility, like Python, Git and Anaconda.

SWC members have created the Python club (a journal club style meeting discussing topics related to Python programming) and PyStarters (a short introductory course on Git, Anaconda and Python programming). These resources are well attended by both SWC and Gatsby members. Besides their technical contributions, they help SWC and GCNU scientists interact with each other.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">3. Proposals to enhance SWC-GCNU collaborations</span>

**_3.1 Create a “data clinic” for SWC to link with GCNU_**

These data clinics could allow anyone from the SWC with a dataset  link with someone from GCNU to discuss how to best model the data. These would be initially informal “starting points” but could develop into something more concrete. The frequency of these clinics could be monthly or termly - depends on how many people would be interested in this. Making it a regular event would make people think about getting advice - I (Ana) would be against an ad-hoc model.

**_3.2 GCNU-SWC PhD rotations_**

Encouraging GCNU to do rotations in SWC and vice versa is a good idea but perhaps it should be “encouraged” and not forced.

For example, in their first year inference course, GCNU PhD students learn about advanced inference methods. After this course they could spend a few months in the laboratory of (for example) John O'Keefe learning about social behavior in mice and applying switching-state Hidden Markov Models to quantitatively monitor the behavior of freely moving socially interacting mice.

Also, in their first year SWC students take the Theoretical and Systems Neuroscience course, where they learn about regression and dynamical systems methods. After this course they could spend a few months working with members of the group of Peter Latham applying what they have learned in this course and developing new methods to understand their neuroscience data.

**_3.2 GNCU-SWC joint journal clubs_**

Encourage SWC scientists to attend the GCNU Theoretical Neuroscience journal club. Stimulate journal clubs led jointly by GCNU and SWC scientists.  It should be a great experience for both GCNU and SWC scientists to jointly prepare and discuss papers of mutual interest.

Does the SWC have center-wide journal clubs? If so, we could encourage GCNU to attend them.

First yr PhDs already have joint JCs during the first term - this doesn’t continue beyond term 1 though - we could suggest extending it?

**Issue**: Due to the grant system, even SWC PIs 1) do not necessarily pursue the science that they believe is most useful to the field in the long term; and 2) spend a lot of time pursuing grants rather than doing science/scholarship/teaching.

**Potential solution**: Negotiate (more) deals for institute-wide funding for research purposes. If SWC PIs are getting $X on avg from Funder Y each year anyway, this makes more sense than going through the grant system. Because this facilitates good science, Funder Y would benefit too. I imagine this is mostly a question of pursuing difficult/uphill/long-term negotiations that I know nothing about.



**Issue**: Topic+method-based (experimental) neuroscience is a norm and is taught to trainees by default. A common formula goes: \
1) Pick a general topic, e.g. escape, reinforcement learning. Pick a task and an array of modern techniques (e.g. large-scale recording). Apply these to a relevant brain region(s).  \
2) Take the positive results, and piece together a broad, intuitively satisfying paper. \
3) Once the trainee leaves, do not re-test in other contexts.

An alternative is science that is driven by a question/hypothesis/theory. For example: \
1) Come up with a specific hypothesis you think is important. Set up/use an experimental paradigm that can address it. Adjust the hypothesis based on pilot data. \
2) Test the modified hypothesis in a new set of animals/cells. Publish results, explaining the hypothesis, result, and assumptions. \
3) Once the trainee leaves, falsify, generalize, or deepen these findings in a new project.

**Potential solution I**: Open discussion. Do people agree with that topic+method-based & individual experimental neuroscience is the default approach (not including methods/theory)? If so, would we like to shift toward question-based & team-based science?

**Potential solution II**: Instil the question-driven approach by requiring/training researchers to go through it. For example, ensure that project proposals/data clubs include specific, tractable hypotheses; justification that the experiments are the best way to address them; the framework for interpreting results; and all relevant assumptions.

**Potential solution III**: Enforced Gatsby-SWC collaboration. Recruit trainees to be coequal-author collaborations between a theorist and an experimentalist, starting from the planning stage of the project. Recruit a theoretical-minded PI to SWC and experiment-minded PI to Gatsby?

**Potential solution IV**: Get rid of the relationship between project execution and a need to publish a first-author paper in a top-tier journal. In my view, this pushes the ‘researcher cost function’ away from thoughtful, cumulative science.


    -       **IVa**: Team science / working groups (see other people’s proposals)


    -       **IVb**: Somehow implement a cultural shift such that which journal we publish in becomes an afterthought, and the question comes first.


    -       **IVc**: Design, fund, and/or point out an existing system for digesting published science that goes beyond subscribing to top-tier journals.

# Fact Finding


### Santa Fe Institute (Spencer)



*   What is the scientific org structure of SFI? How does this relate to the administrative structure?
    *   35 → 70 (30 scientists)** **without much redundancy in speciality

    *   1600 visits per year in the before times -- colloquia, working groups, workshops. Jen decides on these visitors and the events.
    *   Science Steering Committee = People at high level unis.
    *   The metric for success is communication: focused on the newness of the ideas
    *   Architecture intertwines with culture
        *   Escape the constraints
        *   Meet others in open env
        *   Opportunistic collisions
    *   “Science board” -- Less than affiliated, advise president
    *   A dozen non-tenured, grant funded, all treatedlike junior faculty
    *   Postdocs are 3yrs (other places are 2yrs)
*   **Colloquia are mandatory once a month**
*   **Postdocs build communities in other ways**
    *   **Retreats **
    *   **72h of science -- write a paper as a group**
*   Has this structure evolved over time? If so, how?
    *   Hasn’t changed much
    *   Important things
        *   Indoors and outdoors
        *   Pods
        *   People can’t hide
        *   Come together over lunch everyday -- noon every day lunch is here, tea every day
        *   Set and setting
        *   No groups -- no more than 2 postdocs per faculty
        *   Everyone to talk to everyone


### DeepMind (Spencer)



*   success is due to organization, it’s not just great people, it’s structure and culture
*   how can we get to the best of all worlds?
    *   intensity of industry
    *   mission of a big gov project
*   **2D setup of team and topic**

1 efforts:

    - 6 monthly cycles

    - hierarchy of efforts

   	 - 2-3x per 6 months (OKRs 30-50 people)

   	 - smaller the projects, the more of them

   	 - "pushes and projects" (20 and 10)

   	 - down the scale, more speculative

    - everything broken down on milestones

   	 - atomic, specific

   	 - all logged into a tool, specialized for the type of projects

    - big meeting with the whole company -- OKR day every 6 months

2 teams:

    neuro, RL, (now theres a multi-agent team)

efforts draw from teams

manager will have expertise in your area

teams might have one person from an area

each person might be on multiple teams

leaders, contributors, advisor -- in order of time commitment

how are efforts, etc determined/decided?

- merge top-down and bottom-up deep learning

    - using games, deepRL, working in simulation

    - new memory structures will unlock a lot of planning

- these big assumptions are coming from senior leadership

- beginning in demis' head, expand to senior leadership, etc

3 information flow:

- company wide meeting every wednesday (!!) - 1hr

    - nominally not just research, but majority research

    - present recent results for 7-8mins

   	 - team leads suggest presentation at research board meeting on fridays

   		 - most interesting stuff goes to all-hands

    - this meeting feels exciting, not like a boring

   	 - awareness and morale thing

- internal project management tools

- cross-pollination, lateral connections

- is success because of structure or culture?

    - these are connected, so they feed off each other

    - pumping positivity in is crucial to make sure things don't slide

    - collective sense of growth, being well-resourced helps a lot

    - instances of people being competitive for intellectual disputes in good natured way

- values

    - kindness, collaboration, mission-driven

    - vagueness means no real behavior change

    - might be more useful to prescribe behaviors and best-practices

    - maybe values first, then make them concrete

technical lead and program manager on a team

program managers support research teams

    - communication

    - interpersonal issues defusing

    - mixed feelings -- two-class system emerges


### DeepMind (Fred)

Frequent meetings as a tool to create collaborations:



*   2-3 30min meetings per week with immediate collaborators (~4 people); these are scheduled ahead but cut short if not needed
*   1 1h meeting per week with larger group (10-15 people), add 1-2 slides to a common presentation to give an update
*   Every few weeks or months there is the full group meeting with updates on completed milestones; few present and know well in advance, this is roughly like data club

Evaluation of work / progress



*   All progress is tracked, and at end of cycle an evaluation shows productivity

Milestones



*   These are created by people with project ideas who will lead on that milestone; there are collaborators and advisors who are asked to join

Meeting culture



*   People have free access to everyone's calendar; if i need help and want discussion, i look at people’s calendars and find a meeting time that works, propose it over slack to these people and the meeting by default will take 20min
*   Frequent meetings with the same people indicate that a collaboration would be fruitful


### Janelia (Flora)


# -          Limit group size, and thus promote collaboration as the only way for an individual to participate in high-impact questions


# -          Encourage and empower early career researchers (recruit group leaders/janelia fellows  without postdoctoral training), thus early career researchers can take ownership of collaborations


# -          Eliminate time sinks (more staff support, no need to teach or write grants, social support (e.g. support with childcare)


# -          Management determines large programs (e.g. mechanistic cognitive neuroscience) and identifies problems to avoid diversifying into topics that might not be overlapping.


# -          Large focus on tool building and standardization
