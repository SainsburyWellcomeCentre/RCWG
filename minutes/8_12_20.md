# Meeting 8/12/20

## Notes

- Make an agenda next time… 
- Fred (which means more people than Fred) was confused about what was going on, so he made a list of threads of ongoing stuff by reading back through the Slack, etc 
- We need to communicate what’s being brainstormed vs. what’s being worked on actively
- Organization for ourselves:
- Investigate using projects tools on Github → could be useful elsewhere e.g. for science projects
- Investigate whether we can use GitHub to assign specific tasks to individual people so these can - be tracked and for accountability
- RCWG portal -- consensus reached, see proposal protocol below
- Consolidate proposals towards “sleeping on things” over Christmas
- Make sure people are assigned to proposals
- Take 1 or 2 proposals each, think through the implementation directly

## TODO! 
- People adopt proposals as they wish by adding names (at least two to be discussed) 
- Add to proposals with new thinking 
- Organize proposals by theme on the portal from the “threads” slack post 

## Proposal Protocol:
- At least two authors
- Proposals go on github
- Link is posted on the relevant Slack channel
- People respond with clarifications, questions, etc
- Based on the proposal, the authors edit and update the group

## Approval Protocol:
- The small group makes proposals and consensus is built around them
- The faculty meeting objects/clarifies/approves proposals
- Opinions of the whole institute can happen by people joining the group, communicating on slack, etc 
- Proposals are free to browse, organized by whatever the stage the proposal is in 

## Proposals Ongoing

### Data Clubs
- Fred, Philip, Spencer?
- Tom thoughts
	- This should be internal, because stuff leaks
	- Rename them to “SWC Lab Meeting”
	- If the presenter wants to open up the meeting to more people
	- Presenter and PI can choose whether to be a “lab meeting” (within-SWC) or “data club” (+affiliates) 
- Worries about not being open 
	- Open science doesn’t necessarily mean sharing all your data all the time

### Gatsby-SWC rotations
- Joaquin and Ana?
- One SWC rotation could be done at Gatsby
- Gatsby student could jump into SWC lab
- This is a lot do with promoting the opportunities available

### Slack channels
- Spencer and Philip?
- These are more like expertise channels
- Good for Gatsby/SWC interaction
- Rename to expertise channels
- Mathematical methods, data analysis, etc 

### Science Project Platform
- Spencer, Philip?
- IBL has science project registration -- more information about this?
- This is good because
  - Collaborators
  - Feedback from lots of people
  - Forces you to think through the project
