Time to call in the experts.

<!--end summary-->

### Concept

- Talks by external leaders on collaborative research
- Talks on new ideas on how to organize the future of scientific research (e.g. policy, publication system...)

### Purpose

- Learn from other's experiences about the construction of collaborative research environments
- Spark the imagination for what scientific environment we want to build


### Potential Speakers

For example, we could ask:

- Michael Eisen (eLife)
- Graeme Moffat (Munk School Public Policy)
- Patrick Mineault (Neuromatch)
- Olivia Guest (Radboud University)
- Lauren Wool (IBL structure and policy making lead)
- Kirstie Whitaker (Turing Institute)
- Ken Harris and Mateo Carandini (UCL)
- Liam Paninksi (IBL)
- Christof Koch (Allen Institute)
- Demis Hassabis (Deepmind)
- Andre Marques-Smith (series of blogposts on changing the scientific environment)

to deliver talks at the SWC about their experiences and ideas organising their multidisciplinary environments, what things work and what did not, how they perform their sociological experiments (e.g., motivations), how they see the future of team-based Neuroscience.

### Stakeholders

- Anyone interested in sociological aspects of building collaborative research environments.
