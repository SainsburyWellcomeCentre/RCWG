Go back to weekly data club, as opposed to every other week

<!--end summary-->

### Purpose

- Frequent meetings are crucial for a collaborative atmosphere. Researchers voted for data club every other week - we believe this decision should not be up to them. We have to impose a structure in the building where people present frequently and attend meetings, planning experiments around these meetings.


### Implementation

- Weekly SWC labmeeting over lunch 
- PIs should make sure the importance to attend is clear to people
- The brasserie is too small, we should be in the downstairs lecture hall. This means we should find a way for people to have lunch and attend - perhaps the brasserie can provide food downstairs (sandwiches or other type of food that can be eaten easily)?
- Presentation format, alternating weekly:
    * 2 presenters; Research talks; 20min + 5min each
    * 2 presenters; Conceptual talks; 20min + 5min each
- Opt-in if you wish collaborators to be notified
- Include PIs in the rota

### Open questions

- Can we do it in the downstairs lecture hall?
- How is lunch provided?
- Should we only have one label, SWC labmeeting, but put emphasis on not having to present data?
- Should these talks always be available on zoom?

### Stakeholders

- Everyone at SWC
