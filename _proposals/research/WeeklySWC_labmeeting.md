Re-brand data club as lab meeting and go back to weekly rota

<!--end summary-->

### Purpose

- Frequent meetings are crucial for a collaborative atmosphere. Researchers voted for data club every other week - we believe this decision should not be up to them. We have to impose a structure in the building where people present frequently and value attending meetings. Experiments have to be planned around these meetings.

### Implementation

- Weekly SWC labmeeting over lunch in ground floor lecture hall 
- Presentation format:
    * Research or conceptual talks
    * Each week features one lab
    * The presenting lab decides if 1 presenter (40min+15min) or 2 presenters (15min+10min each)
    * Once a month there is a gatsby/swc split meeting
- Include PIs in the rota
- Talks are always available on zoom (in-house)
- PI/presenter can opt-in if you wish London collaborator groups to be notified
- PIs make sure the importance to attend is clear to people
- Lunch is provided

### Open questions

- Can we do it in the downstairs lecture hall?
- How is lunch provided?
- How can we incorporate 1h single presenter slots?
- How do we decide who presents on the swc/gcnu slots?
   * top-down decision by us (use website blurbs (would need to be updated) or google markdown page (would need to be created)) 
   * let PIs decide

### Stakeholders

- Everyone at SWC
