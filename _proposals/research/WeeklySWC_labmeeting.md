Re-brand 'Data Club' to 'SWC Lab Meeting' and return to weekly rota.

<!--end summary-->

### Purpose

- Frequent meetings are crucial for a collaborative atmosphere. Recently, researchers voted for data club every other week - we believe this decision should not be up to them. We have to impose a structure in the building where people present frequently and value attending meetings. Experiments have to be planned around these meetings.

### Implementation

- Weekly SWC labmeeting over lunch in ground floor lecture hall 
- Presentation format:
    * Research or conceptual talks
    * Twice a month there are 2 presenters (15min+10min each)
    * Once a month there is only 1 presenter (40min+15min) 
    * Once a month there is a gcnu/swc split meeting
- Talks are always available on zoom (in-house)
- PI/presenter can opt-in if they wish London collaborator groups to be notified
- PIs make sure the importance to attend is clear to people
- Lunch is provided (Brasserie 'take-out' style)
- How the rota is handled:
   * the 4 short slots are randomised across all swc researchers+PIs
   * the 2 gcnu/swc slots are handpicked initially to ensure common interests
   * the longer slots are randomised across the late phd / postdoc cohort
   * people who want a long slot can swap with someone who is assigned one

### Open questions

- Is the ground floor lecture hall available?
- How is lunch provided?
   * Ask Brasserie to provide 'take out' style lunch on wednesdays
- How do we decide who presents on the 1h slots?
- How do we decide who presents on the swc/gcnu slots?
   * top-down decision by us (use website blurbs (would need to be updated) or google markdown page (would need to be created)) 
   * let PIs decide

### Stakeholders

- Everyone at SWC
