Making sure that all students and postdocs who would like regular feedback can get it

<!--end summary-->

### Motivation

- Improve the project-management aspect of science at SWC. 
- Increase efficiency and motivation. Decrease isolation.
- Many trainees desire regular meetings with their PI and/or other members of their team but feel inhibited from asking for this.


### Implementation (initial idea)

- HR "mandates" that each scientist (phd student, masters student, postdoc, RA) has a conversation with their "project team" in which 
they decide whether they would like regular meetings and if so, how frequent, ~how long, who will attend, and on what day/time
- This conversation should occur as soon as someone starts working here
- The trainee sends the output of this conversation to HR
- The meeting parameters can be adjusted by the team at any point
- Twice per year, HR asks the trainee to what degree the meetings are actually happening, if the parameters have been adjusted, and if the trainee is satisfied with how it's going. If unsatisfied, they encourage the trainee to ask the "team" to make adjustments.
- To be clear: researchers are not required to give regular updates, and PIs are not required to give regular feedback. They are just required to have an explicit conversation about whether this is something that they want.


### Unknowns

- Should this only be put in place for incoming students/postdocs or for everyone?
- Should there be a suggested minimum? For example, a 15-minute meeting once every two weeks or 30-minute meeting once per month?
