Increase internal scientific communication in a welcoming environment.

<!--end summary-->

### Concept

- Data clubs delivered by collaborators


### Purpose

- Demonstrate the potential of scientic collaborations


### Implementation

- These data talks will be delivered by collaborators. Beside showing their scientific results, collaborators may want to talk about the human side of their collaboration (e.g., how the collaboration started, great and not so great moments in their interaction).

- Several scientists are already involved in SWC/GCNU collaborations:

    - Hugo Soulat and Sepi Keshavarzi have quite exciting results,

    - Dario Campagner, Grace Lindsay, George Dimitriadis and Ryan Low are GCNU-SWC research fellows and could tell us about their experiences in their collaborative appointments (things that work well and things that could be improved),

    - Joaquin Rapela is collaborating with Mitra Javadzadeh No and with Cristina Mazuski.
