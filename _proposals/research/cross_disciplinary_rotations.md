Promote collaboration between GCNU and SWC through the PhD program.

<!--end summary-->

### Purpose

Provide SWC PhD students computation research experience mentored by GCNU scientists and provide GCNU PhD students experimental research experience mentored by SWC scientists.


### Implementation

- GCNU PhD students could apply tools they have learned in their courses to  address problems of SWC groups (e.g., use HMMs to characterise social behaviour in Cristina Mazuski's recordings).

- SWC PhD students could apply tools learned in the theoretical Neuroscience course (e.g., linear regression, dynamical systems analysis) to characterise their data with the help of GCNU members (PhD students, postdocs or professors).

- SWC/GCNU PhD students could be mentored by postdoctoral scholars that often are interested in developing mentorship research experience.

### Stakeholders

- SWC/GCNU PhD students
- SWC/GCNU PhD postdocs
- SWC/GCNU PhD principal investigators
