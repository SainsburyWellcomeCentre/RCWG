Provide basic training to SWC/GCNU members on the use of open-science tools

# Purpose

- Allow SWC/GCNU scientist to produced science that can be replicated

# Why should we care about open data-science training?

- The biomedical science is facing a replication crisis ([Button et al., 2013](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3475)). A large proportion (>80%) of recent biomedical findings cannot be replicated ([Open Science Collaboration, 2015](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716)). Thus, it is essential that we disseminate our findings with data (whenever possible), documentation and code to facilitate their replication.

- SWC/GCNU members will benefit their career by learning open data-science tools (e.g., it would be helpful for their CVs to demonstrate that they know how to use these tools),

- SWC/GCNU members can use these tools to make available research they have built internally to the SWC/GCNU or externally to the rest of the world. In this way SWC/GCNU research is better reused and people have another mean of demonstrating their productivity,

- The PyClub and PyStarters are excellent environments to start collaborations between experimental and computational neuroscientists,

- The SWC/GCNU promotes an open-science culture.

# Our vision for the use of open data-science tools at the SWC/GCNU

- The code of every laboratory is under version control in the internal SWC Github organization, very well written and documented. In this way code can be used and reused freely across the SWC/GCNU,

- Every SWC/GCNU member has his own Github account with a personal web site and Github projects, linked to the SWC/GCNU people page, where he/she describes his/her research activities and provides related resources (e.g., source code, protocol documentation). Also, researchers could publish their Github projects with their planned, in progress and done tasks.

For this to happen we want that every laboratory at the SWC/GCNU has at least one member certified on the use of open data-science tools. This person will be responsible of putting all relevant code from his/her laboratory on the internal SWC Github organization and of helping his lab colleagues to use open data-science tools.

### Implementation

- Build on previous work by previous (Charly Rosseau and Maxime Rio) and current (Adam Tyson and Steve Lenzi) SWC members to exapnd open-science related activities at the SWC/GCNU. We will create an **Open Science** organization to centralize activities at the SWC/GCNU related to open science (e.g., teaching Git/Github, Python and Anaconda). 

- Improve the current ([PyClub/PyStarters web site](https://sainsburywellcomecentre.github.io/pystarters/) providing:

    - Contact information of the steering committee and contributors to the organization,

    - Technical information about open data-science tools (e.g., slides from previous PyClubs, PyStarters, links to other useful resources),

    - Information about events (e.g., PyClubs and PyStarters, software carpentry courses at UCL).

- Organize PyClub meetings on a monthly basis,

- Organize PyStarter courses on a yearly basis,

- Setup a mentoring scheme where people with no experience in open data-science tools are paired with people with substantial experience on it.

- Organize advanced courses on, for example, data acquisition, image analysis, time-series analysis and statistical neuroscience.

To produce open science it is important that we know how to use open science tools like Git, Github, Python and Anaconda.

### Stakeholders

- Any SWC/GCNU member producing scientif results.
