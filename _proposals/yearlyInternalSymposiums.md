One-day internal symposium to hear about ongoing research


# Purpose

- Originally suggested by Marcus Stephenson-Jones, this event would help us stay up to date with SWC/GCNU research and boost collaborations


# Implementation

Once every year, dedicate one day to do an internal symposium that includes:
 - talks by some PIs on ongoing research
 - posters by researchers, linked to the talk of the PI, to show more data and help discussing the outlined ideas
 - mingling of researchers and staff during the entire day, including lunch and dinner.
 - implementation of physical 'science channels' during lunch/dinner (e.g. in this table we only talk about how cool phrenology is).
