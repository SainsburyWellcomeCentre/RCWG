Provide open data-science skills to SWC/GCNU members

<!--below excerpt-->

# Our vision for the use of open data-science tools at the SWC/GCNU

- The code of every laboratory is under version control in the internal SWC Github account, very well written and documented. In this way code can be use freely across the SWC/GCNU,

- Every SWC member has his own Github account with a personal web site, linked to the SWC/GCNU people page, where he/she describes his/her research activities and provides related resources (e.g., source code, protocol documentation).

For this to happen we want that every laboratory at the SWC/GCNU has at least one member certified on the use of open data-science tools. This person will be responsible of putting all relevant code from his/her laboratory on the internal SWC Github account and of helping his lab colleagues to use open data-science tools.

# Why should we care about open data-science training?

- The biomedical science is facing a replication crisis (Button et al., 2013). A large proportion (>80%) of recent biomedical findings cannot be replicated (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). Thus, it is essential that we disseminate our findings with data (whenever possible), documentation and code to facilitate their replication.

- SWC/GCNU members will benefit their career by learning open data-science tools (e.g., it would be helpful for their CVs to demonstrate that they know how to use these tools),

- SWC/GCNU members can use these tools to make available research they have built internally to the SWC or externally to the rest of the world. In this way SWC/GCNU research is better reused and people have another mean of demonstrating their productivity,

- The PyClub and PyStarters are excellent environments to start collaborations between experimental and computational neuroscientists,

- The SWC/GCNU aims to release some of the data it generates to the public and having members trained in open data-science tools will help this process.

# What we propose

- Create an **Open Data Science** organization to centralize activities at the SWC/GCNU related to open data science. 

- Build a web site providing:

    - Contact information of the steering committee and contributors to the organization,

    - Technical information about open data-science tools (e.g., slides from previous PyClubs, PyStarters, links to useful resources),

    - Information about events (e.g., PyClubs and PyStarters, software carpentry courses at UCL).

- Organize PyClub meetings on a monthly basis,

- Organize PyStarter courses on a yearly basis. This course could certify on the use of open-science tools to interested students,

- Setup a mentoring scheme where people with no experience in open data-science tools  are paired with people with substantial experience on it.

# We ask the SWC management

- To encourage every lab to certify at least one of its members on the use of open data-science tools,

- That the work of the organizers of the **Open Data Science** organization be weighed in the SWC/GCNU appraisal formula.
