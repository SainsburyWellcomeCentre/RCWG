Getting big ideas off the ground

<!--end summary-->

### Purpose

- To structure and promote collaborative projects at SWC/GCNU


### Implementation

- Structure an internal proposal, review, and project management cycle for independent projects for members of the SWC/GCNU
- Deliverables for projects are in the form of written documents (preprints) though this could be made more flexible depending on the nature of the project (SWC-hosted website showcasing the project)


### Stakeholders

 - Concerns anyone engaged in research at the SWC/GCNU. We should poll this group to gauge their interest in such a scheme
 - GLs may be wary of the scheme as it could detract from their labs’ missions by taking their lab members’ time. There may be a structure that makes this time commitment specific and measurable.
