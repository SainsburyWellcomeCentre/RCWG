Run a Secret Santa contactless gift exchange for the entire SWC/GCNU


### Purpose

Support a festive spirit, acknowledge that this year’s celebrations will have to be different but stressing that Christmas isn’t cancelled


### Implementation

- decide on budget (proposed £10)
- decide on platform (proposed drawnames.co.uk - people can post wishlists and anonymously get in touch with their gift recipient)
- decide on gift exchange date (proposed 17th Dec)
- advertise on Slack / email, ask to sign up until 4th Dec
- draw names on 5th Dec
- make sure people check the name they have drawn
- organise gift drop-off boxes in the 5th floor library
- start a slack thread for people to share their gifts and express their gratitude
