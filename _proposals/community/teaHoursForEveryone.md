Make alternaTEA hours the norm

### Concept

Make the tea hours fun and accessible to everyone by replacing data-heavy neuroscience presentations with games and entertaining popular science talks. While tea hours cannot happen in person, focus particularly on activities that require active participation.


### Purpose

Increase the sense of belonging for everyone in the building, regardless of occupation or career stage


### Implementation

**early idea 2020-10-15**
- create an organiser rota such that all parties from SWC/GCNU are represented
- write organiser guidelines
- define the Best Tea Hour Award
- organise a few tea hours as an example

**a more realistic idea 2021-01-08**
- organise, on average, one alternaTEA hour per month
- perhaps reconsider the early idea once in-person tea hours resume
