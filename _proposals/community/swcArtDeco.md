Improve the building interior


### Purpose

The beautiful SWC building is currently too monotone in its colors, with very little decoration that makes all areas look the same. Some ideas have been raised in order to change this, but they have never been collected into a common effort.


### Implementation

- buy more plants for office spaces and organise the care-taking so they don't die
- coordinate with artists and scientists to create internal science art, and fill the walls with it. Anything could go, from microscopy images, to 3D printed stuff.
