An opportunity to meet people over coffee


### Purpose

Boost the sense of belonging by giving people an extra chance to meet others (virtually at least for the moment) that they do not usually interact with, particularly during lockdown.


### Concept

Everyone gets a randomly assigned coffee partner every x weeks (where x depends on the participants' vote), and each pair is given a fun conversation starter. The pairs organise their (currently virtual) meetings themselves using the dedicated slack channel, private messages, or any other platform of their choice.


### Implementation

- gauge interest by posting on #general slack 
- write code to generate pairs 
- create a slack channel for organising coffee dates #social-coffee-roulette
- come up with conversation starters
- ask participants to vote on meeting frequency
- run code every x weeks (where x = preferred meeting frequency)
