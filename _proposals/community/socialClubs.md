Establish a body that supports social interest groups


### Purpose

Increase interactions across SWC-Gatsby building, increase sense of belonging, increase wellbeing.


### Implementation

- explore opportunities to get SWC funding
- transform existing endeavours (e.g. squash, pingpong, bookclub, choir) into Social Clubs
- draft a guide of what fits within the limits of a Social Club and the steps one would have to take to create a new Social Club
- create a virtual/physicial platform for advertising Social Clubs
- constitute a committee to oversee the creation of new Social Clubs and allocate funding
- advertise this idea to the building
- suggestion: call the initiator of a Social Club the Principal Instigator (PI)
