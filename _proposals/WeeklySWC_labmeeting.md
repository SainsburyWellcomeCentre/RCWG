Re-brand data club as lab meeting and go back to weekly rota

<!--end summary-->

### Purpose

- Frequent meetings are crucial for a collaborative atmosphere. Researchers voted for data club every other week - we believe this decision should not be up to them. We have to impose a structure in the building where people present frequently and value attending meetings. Experiments have to be planned around these meetings.

### Implementation

- Weekly SWC labmeeting over lunch 
- Presentation format:
    * Research or conceptual talks
    * 2 presenters; aim to talk for 15min + 10min discussion each
- Include PIs in the rota
- PI/presenter can opt-in if you wish London collaborator groups to be notified
- PIs make sure the importance to attend is clear to people
- The brasserie is too small - relocate to downstairs lecture hall
- Lunch is provided

### Open questions

- Can we do it in the downstairs lecture hall?
- How is lunch provided?
- Should these talks always be available on zoom for internal viewing?
- How can we incorporate 1h single presenter slots?
- How do we best mix SWC/GCNU?

### Stakeholders

- Everyone at SWC
