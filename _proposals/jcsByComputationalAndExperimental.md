Journal clubs jointly delivered by a mixture of computational and experimental scientists

<!--below excerpt-->

### Purpose

- Foster scientific interactions between computational and experimental scientists at the SWC.


### Implementation

- For example, a GCNU scientist may be interested in presenting a paper about memory reconsolidation. To gain a deeper insight about the experimental side of this problem he may reach a scientist from John O'Keefe lab and ask her if she could provide him further insight on experimental details of the paper and propose her to deliver a collaborative journal club about this paper.

### Stakeholders

- SWC/GCNU scientists.
