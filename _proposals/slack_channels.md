Additional Slack channels for discussion and Q&A about technical topics.

<!--below excerpt-->

# Purpose

- We seek a culture that promotes skill sharing and learning

# Aims

-  Add additional communication channels that promote the discussion and sharing of expertise so that people feel encouraged to ask questions and discuss learning new skills

# Implementation

- Develop a list of possible new channels
- Develop a list of channels to consolidate 
- Add those channels with the correct Slack naming conventions (do we need a new category e.g. `#python-expertise`?)
- Announce new and consolidated channels to `#general`


# Stakeholders

- If channels are consolidated, those channels need to reach consensus about the change
- S-RCWG group must reach consensus about the new channels to be added

# Unknowns

- Will the creation of these new channels alone lead to more active discussion and group learning? Or will we need to do more to promote this?
