title: Expertise Slack Channels
authors: Philip Shamash, Tom Mrsic-Flogel
---

Slack channels for discussion and Q&A about technical topics, analysis, and concepts.

<!--below excerpt-->

# Aim

-  Add additional communication channels that promote the sharing of expertise; encourage people to ask questions and discuss answers in a public forum.

# To-Do

- Coordinate with emma to create the channels on the list below (in a folder, ideally)
- Coordinate with Ana and Barry to create a tunnel from the Gatsby slack to the SWC slack
- Announce these channels at the Town Hall 29.1.21 3pm
- Week of 2.2.21: create channels, add all researchers, send an email and a slack message on general (including promoting existing channels)
- Week of 9.2.21: organize questions to plant on each channel to serve as an example of how to use the forums
- Week of 24.2.21: reassess, and engage particular experts if it's not happening organically

## Current list of channels to add
**forum-analysis** Data analysis, statistics, and modeling - how should I tag outliers in this dataset?

**forum-programming** programming questions in any language - should I use classes or functions for my Python analysis?

**forum-conceptual** tricky or ambiguous concepts from the literature - what is the significance of grid cell warping?

**forum-behaviour** help with animal behavior work - how do you get mice to escape without habituation?

**forum-imaging** help with optical imaging methods including image processing - which fluorophore should I use for my expt?

**forum-optogenetics** help with optogenetics - how can I stimulate and inhibit the same population of neurons?

**forum-extracellular-ephys** help with extracellular ephys - I'd like to set up recordings of entorhinal cortex, should I use tetrodes or neuropixel?

**forum-patching** Patching and similar experiments - I've been experiencing a lot of noise on the patch rig this week, are others in the building having this too?

**forum-molecular-bio** help with cell-type markers, labeling, sequencing/transcriptomics - has anyone used RNA scope for identifying cell types of interest and can help?

**forum-machine-learning-NNs** Machine learning and neural network models - How do I put dropout in my PyTorch network?

**forum-misc-questions** Questions that don't fit into the other categories.

## Existing channels to promote in the email/message
**cores-virology** - Does this hSyn-eNpHR virus work in thalamus?

**cores-fablab** - Which company should I use to 3D print from this CAD drawing?
