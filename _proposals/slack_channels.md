authors: Philip Shamash, Tom Mrsic-Flogel

Slack channels for discussion and Q&A about technical topics, analysis, and concepts.

<!--below excerpt-->

# Aim

-  Add additional communication channels that promote the sharing of expertise; encourage people to ask questions and discuss answers in a public forum.

# To-Do

- Coordinate with emma to create the channels on the list below
- Coordinate with Ana/Barry/John to create a tunnel from the Gatsby slack to the SWC slack on these channels
- Announce these channels at the Town Hall 29.1.21 3pm
- Week of 2.2.21: add all researchers, send an email and a slack message on general (including promoting existing channels)
- Week of 9.2.21: organize questions to plant on each channel to serve as an example of how to use the forums
- Week of 24.2.21: reassess, and engage particular experts if it's not happening organically

## Current list of channels to add
**forum-analysis** Data analysis, statistics, and modeling questions 
- how should I tag outliers in this dataset?

**forum-programming** questions about programming in any language 
- should I use classes or functions for my Python analysis?

**forum-conceptual** discussion on confusing and/or interesting concepts from the literature
- what is the significance of grid cell warping?

**forum-behaviour** questions about animal behavior
- how do you get mice to escape without habituation?

**forum-imaging** help with optical imaging methods including image processing
- which fluorophore should I use for my expt?

**forum-optogenetics** help with optogenetics
- how can I stimulate and inhibit the same population of neurons?

**forum-extracellular-ephys** help with extracellular ephys
- I'd like to set up recordings of entorhinal cortex, should I use tetrodes or neuropixel?

**forum-patching** help with patching and related methods
- I've been experiencing a lot of noise on the patch rig this week, are others in the building having this too?

**forum-molecular-bio** help with cell-type markers, labeling, sequencing/transcriptomics, etc
- has anyone used RNA scope for identifying cell types of interest and can help?

**forum-ML-and-neural-networks** Machine learning and neural networks questions
- How do I put dropout in my PyTorch network?

**forum-misc** Science questions that don't fit into the other categories.

## Existing channels to promote in the email/message
**cores-virology** 
- Does this hSyn-eNpHR virus work in thalamus?

**cores-fablab** 
- Which company should I use to 3D print from this CAD drawing?
