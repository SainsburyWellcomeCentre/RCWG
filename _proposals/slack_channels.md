Additional Slack channels for discussion and Q&A about technical topics.

<!--below excerpt-->

# Purpose

- We seek a culture that promotes skill sharing and learning

# Aims

-  Add additional communication channels that promote the discussion and sharing of expertise so that people feel encouraged to ask questions and discuss learning new skills

# Implementation

- Develop a list of possible new channels
- Develop a list of channels to consolidate 
- Add those channels with the correct Slack naming conventions (do we need a new category e.g. `#python-expertise`?)
- Announce new and consolidated channels to `#general`; send an email asking people to be experts on the channels; announce at Town Hall
- Ask individual experts if there are not enough people volunteering
- Add Gatsby people to SWC slack / the relevant channels

# Stakeholders

- S-RCWG group must reach consensus about the new channels to be added
- Experts need to join the channels and answer questions
- Researchers need to feel comfortable asking questions on these channels

# Unknowns

- Will the creation of these new channels lead to more active discussion and group learning? Or will we need to do more to promote this?
- Will Gatsby people get involved in answering questions? Will they want to ask questions?
