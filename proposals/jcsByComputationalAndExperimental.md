Proposal: Journal clubs delivered by experimental and computational neuroscientists
===================================================================================

# Author(s):

- Joaquin Rapela


# Concept

- Journal clubs delivered by a mixture of computational en experimental neuroscientists


# Purpose

- Foster scientific interactions between computational and experimental neuroscientists at the SWC.


# Implementation

- For example, a GCNU scientist may be interested in presenting a paper about memory reconsolidation. To gain a deeper insight about the experimental side of this problem he may reach a scientist from John O'Keefe lab and ask her if she could provide him further insight on experimental details of the paper and propose he to deliver a collaborative journal club about this paper.

# Stakeholders

- SWC/GCNU scientists.
