Proposal: Talks by external leaders in collaborative research
=============================================================

# Author(s):

- Joaquin Rapela


# Concept

- Talks by external leaders on collaborative research


# Purpose

- Learn from other's experiences about the construction of collaborative research environments


# Implementation

For example, we could ask:

- Ken Harris and Mateo Carandini, or Liam Panininksi (IBL)
- Christof Koch (Allen Institute)
- Demis Hassabis (Deepmind)

to deliver talks at the SWC about their experiences organising their multidisciplinary environments, what things work and what did not, how they perform their sociological experiments (e.g., motivations), how they see the future of team-based Neuroscience.

# Stakeholders

- Anyone interested in sociological aspects of building collaborative research environments.
