Proposal: Science woring groups
===============================

# Author(s):

# Concept

- Create science working groups

# Purpose

- Create working groups taclking a larger problem by bringing together scientists with different expertise

# Implementation

We decide to work on a problem (e.g., advanced characterisation of population neural recordings), we agree to use a given dataset (maybe provided by one of the working group members), we collaborate closely in solving this problem and we publish together (with a clear description of contributions).

I thought about the following three working groups:

- **Neural population analysis**

Many scientists at the SWC are using Neuropixel probes. This working group could focus on using advanced statistical techniques to characterise neural population dynamics.

- **Quantitative description of mice behaviour**

The quantitative description of mice behaviour is another problem that many scientists at the SWC need to address. We would try to find the syllables of behaviour using state-of-the-art methods.

- **Biophysically-inspired modelling of neural dynamics**

Biophysically-inspired models describe neural dynamics using detailed neural information (they simulate large populations of single neurons, with information about neural connectivity, and neural type). The single-neuron population activity predicted by these models can be linked to other population recordings (e.g., LFPs and calcium imaging). And from these other population recordings we could then infer details at the single-cell resolution. Imaging how great it could be to infer the neural basis of epilepsy from ECoG recordings!

Tiago Branco has expertise developing biophysically-inspired models. Steve West (SWC/IBL Histology Research Scientist) is developing techniques that could provide us exquisite anatomical information. The GCNU could contribute its world-class inference expertise.
