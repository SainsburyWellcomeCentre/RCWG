Proposal: (Certified) training in open-science tools
====================================================

# Author(s):

- Joaquin Rapela


# Concept

- Provide basic training to SWC/GCNU members on the use of open-science tools


# Purpose

- Allow SWC/GCNU scientist to produced science that can be replicated

# Motivations

- The biomedical science is facing a replication crisis. A large proportion (>70%) of recent biomedical findings cannot be replicated. Thus, it is essential that we disseminate our findings with data (whenever possible), documentation and code to facilitate their replication.

- It is also of interest to SWC members to disseminate their work to show others their research. 

# Implementation

To produce open science it is important that we know how to use open science tools like Git, Github, Conda and Python.

We have organised the **PyStarters** course teaching SWC/GCNU members to open-science tools. We also had the the journal-club-style **PyClub**, where we discussed Python, and other open-science-related tools. Besides discussing tools, these events are great to foster interactions and collaborations.

I suggest that after the PyStarters course we offer a **certification** exam, that validates that people that passed this exam have a good understanding of open-science tools. We could then recommend every lab at the SWC/GCNU to have at least one member that is certified in open-science tools.

# Stakeholders

- Any SWC/GCNU producing scientif results.
