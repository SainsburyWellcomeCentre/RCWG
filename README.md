# How to Test Locally

- Download [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) following the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll). You'll need a package manager, `ruby`, and `bundler`. Don't forget to run `gem install bundler`.
- Once you've got everything installed, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start a development server at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`, just go there in your browser.
- If you have issues, try running `bundle update`. If that doesn't work, open an issue or reach out on Slack.
- Changes made to documents should automagically update in your browser.
